# TechNova Solutions: Payment Security Policy

## Overview
TechNova Solutions, a fictional e-commerce retailer, is implementing a compliance program for [PCI-DSS v4.0.0](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/?document=pci_dss) to secure cardholder data. This document outlines the payment security policies to protect the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) in accordance with PCI-DSS requirements.

## Payment Security Policies
TechNova Solutions enforces the following policies to ensure the security of cardholder data:

1. **Data Storage Restrictions**
   - Cardholder data (e.g., Primary Account Number, cardholder name, expiration date) is not stored unless absolutely necessary.
   - Sensitive authentication data (e.g., CVV, PIN) is never stored after authorization, per PCI-DSS Requirement 3.2.
   - Stored data is encrypted using strong cryptography (e.g., AES-256).

2. **Encryption of Data Transmission**
   - All cardholder data transmitted over public or untrusted networks (e.g., internet) is encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3), per PCI-DSS Requirement 4.1.
   - Secure channels are established for all payment processing transactions.

3. **Access Control**
   - Access to cardholder data is restricted to authorized personnel based on a need-to-know basis, per PCI-DSS Requirement 7.1.
   - Role-based access controls (RBAC) are implemented to limit data exposure.
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all access to the CDE, per PCI-DSS Requirement 8.3.

4. **Secure Payment Processing**
   - Payment systems are configured to comply with PCI-DSS Requirement 1 (secure network) and Requirement 6 (secure software).
   - Third-party payment processors are verified to be PCI-DSS compliant.
   - Tokenization is used to replace sensitive data with non-sensitive equivalents where possible.

5. **Employee Training and Awareness**
   - All employees handling cardholder data undergo annual security awareness training, per PCI-DSS Requirement 12.6.
   - Policies are communicated to ensure compliance with secure data handling procedures.

6. **Incident Response**
   - A formal incident response plan is maintained to address potential data breaches, per PCI-DSS Requirement  Twelfth.
   - Immediate reporting and containment procedures are in place for suspected security incidents.

## TechNova Solutions Implementation
TechNova Solutions will implement these policies by:
- Deploying encryption and tokenization solutions for data protection.
- Integrating MFA and RBAC into all systems accessing the CDE.
- Regularly auditing third-party payment processors for compliance.
- Conducting employee training sessions and phishing simulations.
- Testing the incident response plan annually.
