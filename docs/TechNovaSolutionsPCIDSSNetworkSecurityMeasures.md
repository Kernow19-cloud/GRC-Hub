# TechNova Solutions: Network Security Measures

## Overview
TechNova Solutions, a fictional e-commerce retailer, is implementing a compliance program for [PCI-DSS v4.0.0](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/?document=pci_dss) to secure cardholder data. This document outlines the network security controls for the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) to meet PCI-DSS requirements.

## Network Security Controls
TechNova Solutions implements the following controls to secure the CDE:

1. **Firewall and Network Security**
   - Deploy firewalls at all CDE boundaries to control inbound and outbound traffic, per PCI-DSS Requirement 1.1.
   - Maintain firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic, reviewed quarterly, per PCI-DSS Requirement 1.1.2.
   - Prohibit direct public access to the CDE, using DMZs and private IP addressing, per PCI-DSS Requirement 1.3.

2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Segment the CDE from other networks to reduce the scope of PCI-DSS compliance, per PCI-DSS Requirement 1.2.
   - Use VLANs and access control lists (ACLs) to isolate cardholder data systems.
   - Document and monitor network segmentation configurations.

3. **Secure Configurations**
   - Apply secure configuration standards to all CDE systems (e.g., servers, routers), per PCI-DSS Requirement 2.2.
   - Disable unnecessary services, ports, and protocols (e.g., unused TCP/UDP ports), per PCI-DSS Requirement 2.2.2.
   - Use industry-standard hardening guidelines (e.g., CIS benchmarks).

4. **Wireless Security**
   - Secure wireless networks accessing the CDE with WPA3 encryption, per PCI-DSS Requirement 1.2.3.
   - Conduct regular scans for rogue wireless access points, per PCI-DSS Requirement 11.1.
   - Isolate wireless networks from the CDE unless explicitly required.

5. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**
   - Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor CDE traffic, per PCI-DSS Requirement 11.4.
   - Configure IDPS to alert on suspicious activity and block potential threats.
   - Review IDPS logs daily for security incidents.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Implement centralized logging for all CDE systems, capturing access and changes, per PCI-DSS Requirement 10.1.
   - Secure log data with restricted access and encryption, per PCI-DSS Requirement 10.5.
   - Retain logs for at least one year, with three months immediately available, per PCI-DSS Requirement 10.7.

## TechNova Solutions Implementation
TechNova Solutions will enforce these controls by:
- Configuring firewalls and ACLs to protect the CDE.
- Implementing network segmentation with regular audits.
- Applying automated hardening scripts to CDE systems.
- Deploying WPA3-secured wireless networks and rogue AP detection tools.
- Integrating IDPS with real-time alerting and response.
- Using a SIEM solution for log management and monitoring.
