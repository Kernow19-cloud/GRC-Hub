# TechNova Solutions: PCI-DSS Fundamentals

## Overview
TechNova Solutions, a fictional e-commerce retailer, is implementing a compliance program for [PCI-DSS v4.0.0](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/?document=pci_dss) to secure cardholder data. This document outlines the fundamental requirements of PCI-DSS to ensure a secure Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).

## PCI-DSS Requirements
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) v4.0.0 consists of 12 core requirements, grouped into six control objectives:

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems**
   - Install and maintain network security controls.
   - Apply secure configurations to systems.

2. **Protect Account Data**
   - Protect stored account data.
   - Encrypt cardholder data transmission over public networks.

3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**
   - Use and update anti-malware software.
   - Develop and maintain secure systems and software.

4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**
   - Restrict access to cardholder data by need-to-know.
   - Authenticate access to system components.
   - Restrict physical access to cardholder data.

5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**
   - Monitor access to network resources and cardholder data.
   - Test security systems and processes regularly.

6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**
   - Maintain a policy for information security.

## TechNova Solutions Approach
TechNova Solutions will comply by:
- Using firewalls and secure network configurations.
- Encrypting cardholder data storage and transmission.
- Implementing role-based access and multi-factor authentication.
- Conducting vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
- Establishing an information security policy.
