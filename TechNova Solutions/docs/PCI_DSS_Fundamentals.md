# PCI-DSS Fundamentals

## Overview
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. TechNova Solutions is working towards compliance with PCI-DSS v4.0.

## Key Requirements
PCI-DSS v4.0 includes 12 core requirements, grouped into 6 control objectives:

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems**
   - Install and maintain network security controls.
   - Apply secure configurations to all system components.

2. **Protect Cardholder Data**
   - Protect stored account data.
   - Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.

3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**
   - Protect systems against malware.
   - Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.

4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**
   - Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know.
   - Identify and authenticate access to system components.
   - Restrict physical access to cardholder data.

5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**
   - Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
   - Regularly test security systems and processes.

6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**
   - Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.

TechNova Solutions will address each requirement through policies, procedures, and technical controls. See other documents in this repository for detailed implementations.
