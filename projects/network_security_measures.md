# Network Security Measures

## Overview
PaySafe Retail’s cardholder data environment (CDE) is minimal, as payment processing is outsourced to PaySafe’s Hosted Payments API. Network security measures focus on protecting systems that interact with the API, ensuring PCI-DSS v4.0.0 compliance (Requirements 1, 2, 11).

## Security Controls
1. **Firewall Configuration (Requirement 1)**
   - Deploy iptables rules to restrict inbound and outbound traffic (`src/firewall_config.sh`).
   - Allow only HTTPS (port 443) for API communication and SSH (port 22) for admin access.
   - Deny all other traffic by default.

2. **Secure Configurations (Requirement 2)**
   - Harden systems interacting with the API (e.g., e-commerce servers).
   - Disable unnecessary services and default accounts.
   - Apply security patches monthly.

3. **Vulnerability Scanning (Requirement 11)**
   - Conduct monthly network vulnerability scans (`src/vulnerability_scan.py`).
   - Target systems in scope (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
   - Remediate high-severity vulnerabilities within 30 days.

4. **Network Segmentation**
   - Segment API-interfacing systems from other networks.
   - Use VLANs to isolate e-commerce servers from internal systems.
   - Document network topology (stored securely).

5. **Monitoring (Requirement 10)**
   - Monitor network access logs for systems in scope (`src/log_monitor.py`).
   - Log all API interactions (`logs/payment_api.log`).
   - Review logs weekly for anomalies.

## Implementation
- **Tools**:
  - `src/firewall_config.sh`: Firewall setup.
  - `src/vulnerability_scan.py`: Vulnerability scanning.
  - `src/log_monitor.py`: Log monitoring.
- **Configs**:
  - `configs/encryption.conf`: Ensures TLS 1.3 for API traffic.
  - `configs/access_control.yaml`: Restricts network access to authorized roles.

## Maintenance
- Review firewall rules quarterly.
- Update vulnerability scan targets as systems change.
- Retain scan reports and logs for one year.
