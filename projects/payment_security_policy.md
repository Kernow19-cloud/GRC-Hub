# Payment Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy ensures PaySafe Retail secures payment processing in compliance with PCI-DSS v4.0.0, protecting cardholder data during transactions via PaySafe’s Hosted Payments API.

## Scope
Applies to:
- Systems integrating with PaySafe’s API (e.g., e-commerce platform).
- Employees and contractors handling payment workflows.
- Tools and configurations in this repository.

## Policies
1. **Secure Transmission (Requirement 4)**:
   - All API calls to PaySafe’s Hosted Payments API must use TLS 1.3 (see `configs/encryption.conf`).
   - Verify certificates for all HTTPS connections (`examples/hosted_payment_api.py`).

2. **No Local Storage (Requirement 3)**:
   - Cardholder data must not be stored on PaySafe Retail systems.
   - Payment processing is fully outsourced to PaySafe’s API.

3. **Access Control (Requirement 7)**:
   - Restrict access to payment systems to authorized roles (e.g., `admin`, `payment_processor`; see `configs/access_control.yaml`).
   - Review access permissions quarterly.

4. **Monitoring and Logging (Requirement 10)**:
   - Log all payment API interactions (`examples/hosted_payment_api.py` logs to `logs/payment_api.log`).
   - Monitor logs for unauthorized access using `src/log_monitor.py`.
   - Retain logs for one year, with three months readily accessible.

5. **Vulnerability Management (Requirement 11)**:
   - Conduct monthly vulnerability scans on systems interacting with the API (`src/vulnerability_scan.py`).
   - Remediate critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

6. **Employee Training (Requirement 12.6)**:
   - Train staff annually on secure payment handling and PCI-DSS policies.
   - Document training completion and store securely.

## Incident Response
- Report suspected payment security incidents to compliance@paysafe-retail.com within 24 hours.
- Follow incident response procedures (e.g., isolate affected systems, notify PaySafe).

## Review
- Review this policy annually or after significant changes to payment processes.
- Update via change management process (Requirement 6).
