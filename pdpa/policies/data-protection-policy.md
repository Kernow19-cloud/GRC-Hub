# Data Protection Policy for DataSafe Solutions (PDPA)

## Overview
This policy outlines the data protection requirements for **DataSafe Solutions**, a fictional Singapore-based fintech company offering digital payment platforms, to comply with the **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)**. It ensures personal data is handled responsibly, protecting customer privacy and meeting regulatory obligations. See [PDPA Fundamentals](../compliance/pdpa-fundamentals.md) for details on PDPA obligations and the [PDPA Project README](../readme.md) for project scope.

## Policies
The following policies align with PDPA’s nine key obligations to govern DataSafe’s data handling practices:

1. **Consent**:
   - Explicit consent must be obtained before collecting, using, or disclosing personal data.
   - **Implementation**: Consent checkboxes are mandatory on app registration forms, with opt-in options clearly stated.

2. **Purpose Limitation**:
   - Personal data is used only for purposes explicitly communicated and consented to by individuals.
   - **Implementation**: Privacy policies document data usage purposes (e.g., payment processing, customer support), enforced by system restrictions.

3. **Notification**:
   - Individuals must be informed of data collection purposes before or at the time of collection.
   - **Implementation**: Privacy notices are displayed prominently on app interfaces and websites prior to data collection.

4. **Access and Correction**:
   - Individuals have the right to access their personal data and request corrections for inaccuracies.
   - **Implementation**: User account portals allow customers to view, edit, and update their personal data securely.

5. **Accuracy**:
   - Personal data must be accurate and complete, particularly for decision-making purposes.
   - **Implementation**: Input validation (e.g., email, phone formats) is enforced during app registration to ensure data accuracy.

6. **Protection**:
   - Robust security measures protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.
   - **Implementation**: AES-256 encryption secures data at rest, TLS 1.3 protects data in transit, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for system access.

7. **Retention Limitation**:
   - Personal data is retained only as long as necessary for its purpose or legal requirements.
   - **Implementation**: Inactive user data is deleted after 3 years via automated data purging processes.

8. **Transfer Limitation**:
   - Personal data transfers are restricted to jurisdictions with comparable data protection standards.
   - **Implementation**: International data transfers are limited to PDPA-compliant regions, with contractual clauses for third-party processors.

9. **Accountability**:
   - Compliance is demonstrated through governance, documentation, and a designated Data Protection Officer (DPO).
   - **Implementation**: A DPO oversees PDPA adherence, and records of data processing activities are maintained.

## Responsibilities
- **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Oversees policy implementation, conducts compliance audits, and serves as the point of contact for data protection queries.
- **IT Security Team**: Implements and maintains technical safeguards (e.g., encryption, MFA, access controls).
- **Training Coordinator**: Ensures all employees complete annual PDPA training.
- **Employees**: Adhere to this policy and report data protection concerns to the DPO.
- **Management**: Approves resources and ensures alignment with business objectives.

## Enforcement
- **Audits**: Quarterly compliance audits verify adherence to this policy and PDPA requirements.
- **Violations**: Non-compliance (e.g., unauthorized data access) results in disciplinary action, including retraining or termination.
- **Incident Reporting**: Data breaches must be reported to the DPO within 24 hours for assessment and notification per PDPA guidelines.

## Notes
- This is a **fictional** policy for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Aligns with Singapore’s PDPA requirements as of April 2025.
