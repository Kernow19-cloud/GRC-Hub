# PDPA Fundamentals for DataSafe Solutions

## Overview
This document outlines the **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)** fundamentals for **DataSafe Solutions**, a fictional Singapore-based fintech company offering digital payment platforms. The PDPA governs personal data protection in Singapore, ensuring customer privacy and regulatory compliance. This supports DataSafe’s compliance efforts as detailed in the [PDPA Project README](../readme.md).

## PDPA Key Obligations
The PDPA imposes nine key obligations, applied to DataSafe’s operations to protect personal data:

1. **Consent Obligation**:
   - Obtain explicit consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal data.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Include consent checkboxes in payment app registration forms, allowing users to opt-in for data collection.

2. **Purpose Limitation Obligation**:
   - Use personal data only for purposes communicated and consented to.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Document data usage purposes (e.g., payment processing, marketing) in privacy policies and restrict usage accordingly.

3. **Notification Obligation**:
   - Inform individuals of the purposes for data collection, use, or disclosure.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Display clear privacy notices on app interfaces and websites before data collection.

4. **Access and Correction Obligation**:
   - Allow individuals to access their personal data and correct inaccuracies.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Provide user account portals enabling customers to view and update their data.

5. **Accuracy Obligation**:
   - Ensure personal data is accurate and complete, especially if used for decision-making.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Validate user inputs (e.g., email, phone) during app registration to maintain data accuracy.

6. **Protection Obligation**:
   - Implement security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access or loss.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for system access.

7. **Retention Limitation Obligation**:
   - Retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose or legal requirements.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Delete inactive user data after 3 years, with automated data purging processes.

8. **Transfer Limitation Obligation**:
   - Restrict data transfers to jurisdictions with comparable data protection laws.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Limit international data transfers to PDPA-compliant regions, with contractual safeguards for third-party processors.

9. **Accountability Obligation**:
   - Demonstrate compliance through policies, a Data Protection Officer (DPO), and documentation.
   - **DataSafe Implementation**: Appoint a DPO to oversee PDPA compliance and maintain records of data processing activities.
