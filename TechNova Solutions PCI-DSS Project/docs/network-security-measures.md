# Network Security Measures

## Overview
TechNova Solutions implements network security controls to protect the **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)** in compliance with **PCI-DSS v4.0.0**. These measures secure systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access and threats.

## Security Controls
1. **Network Segmentation**:
   - Isolate the CDE from other networks using VLANs and firewalls.
   - Restrict traffic to/from the CDE to only necessary protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH).

2. **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection**:
   - Deploy stateful firewalls to filter inbound/outbound CDE traffic.
   - Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect threats.
   - Review firewall/IDS logs daily.

3. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt stored CHD using AES-256 with secure key management.
   - Use TLS 1.3 for CHD transmission over public networks.
   - Implement end-to-end encryption for payment processing.

4. **Access Controls**:
   - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for CDE access.
   - Use unique user IDs with strong passwords (12+ characters).
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit CHD access.

5. **System Hardening**:
   - Remove default accounts and disable unnecessary services.
   - Apply security patches within 30 days of release.
   - Configure systems per CIS benchmarks.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Enable centralized logging for all CDE systems.
   - Use file integrity monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes.
   - Retain logs for at least one year, with three months immediately accessible.

7. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Conduct quarterly external vulnerability scans by an ASV.
   - Perform annual internal/external penetration tests.
   - Remediate critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

8. **Physical Security**:
   - Restrict data center access with badge systems and CCTV.
   - Secure physical media (e.g., backups) in locked storage.
