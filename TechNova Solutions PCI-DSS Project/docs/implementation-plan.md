# Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps for TechNova Solutions to achieve and maintain **PCI-DSS v4.0.0** compliance. It is divided into phases with timelines and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Scoping and Assessment (1 Month)
- **Objective**: Define the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) and assess compliance gaps.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify systems/processes handling CHD/SAD.
popular: Identify systems/processes handling cardholder data (CHD) or sensitive authentication data (SAD).
  2. Document CHD data flows (e.g., payment processing, refunds).
  3. Conduct a gap assessment against PCI-DSS v4.0.0.
  4. Engage a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).
- **Deliverables**: CDE scope document, gap assessment report.

## Phase 2: Policy and Process Development (2 Months)
- **Objective**: Develop policies/procedures to address gaps.
- **Steps**:
  1. Draft the [Payment Security Policy](./payment-security-policy.md).
  2. Develop procedures for encryption, access control, and monitoring.
  3. Update third-party contracts for compliance.
- **Deliverables**: Security policy, procedure documents.

## Phase 3: Technical Implementation (3 Months)
- **Objective**: Implement security controls in the CDE.
- **Steps**:
  1. Deploy firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and anti-malware.
  2. Configure systems for secure settings (e.g., disable unnecessary services).
  3. Implement encryption (AES-256 for storage, TLS 1.3 for transmission).
  4. Enable logging and monitoring tools.
- **Deliverables**: Configured systems, encryption certificates.

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation (2 Months)
- **Objective**: Verify compliance through testing.
- **Steps**:
  1. Conduct quarterly vulnerability scans.
  2. Perform annual penetration testing.
  3. Complete Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) or Report on Compliance (RoC).
- **Deliverables**: Scan reports, penetration test results, SAQ/RoC.

## Phase 5: Ongoing Compliance (Continuous)
- **Objective**: Maintain compliance through monitoring and training.
- **Steps**:
  1. Conduct annual employee training.
  2. Perform regular risk assessments.
  3. Monitor logs and respond to incidents.
- **Deliverables**: Training records, risk assessment reports.
