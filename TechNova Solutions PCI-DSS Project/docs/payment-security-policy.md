# Payment Security Policy

## Overview
TechNova Solutionsâ€™ Payment Security Policy ensures the protection of cardholder data (CHD) and sensitive authentication data (SAD) in compliance with **PCI-DSS v4.0.0**. This policy governs data handling, access, and incident response.

## Policy Objectives
- Minimize CHD/SAD storage.
- Protect CHD/SAD during storage, processing, and transmission.
- Ensure compliance across all operations.

## Key Policies
1. **Data Minimization**:
   - Store only necessary CHD (e.g., primary account number (PAN) if required).
   - Prohibit SAD storage (e.g., CVV, PIN) unless justified.
   - Use tokenization to replace PAN with non-sensitive tokens.

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt stored CHD with strong cryptography (e.g., AES-256).
   - Use secure protocols for CHD transmission (e.g., TLS 1.3).
   - Mask PAN when displayed (e.g., show last four digits).

3. **Access Control**:
   - Restrict CHD access to authorized personnel.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for CDE access.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) for least privilege.

4. **Third-Party Management**:
   - Ensure third-party providers (e.g., payment gateways) are PCI-DSS compliant.
   - Maintain contracts defining security responsibilities.
   - Monitor third-party compliance annually.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Maintain an incident response plan for data breaches.
   - Train employees to report incidents immediately.
   - Notify card brands/authorities within 24 hours of a breach.

6. **Employee Training**:
   - Conduct annual PCI-DSS awareness training.
   - Provide role-specific training for CHD-handling staff.

7. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Enable logging for all CDE activities.
   - Conduct quarterly vulnerability scans and annual penetration tests.
   - Review logs daily for suspicious activity.
