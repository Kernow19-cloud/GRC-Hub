# NIST CSF Fundamentals for TechSecure Solutions

## Overview
This document outlines the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** fundamentals for **TechSecure Solutions**, a fictional U.S.-based technology firm providing cloud services to small businesses. The NIST CSF provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks through its five core functions: **Identify**, **Protect**, **Detect**, **Respond**, and **Recover**. This document supports TechSecure’s compliance efforts as detailed in the [NIST CSF Project README](../readme.md).

## NIST CSF Core Functions
The NIST CSF organizes cybersecurity activities into five core functions, each with categories and subcategories tailored to TechSecure’s operations:

1. **Identify**:
   - **Purpose**: Understand the organization’s assets, risks, and cybersecurity posture.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - **Asset Management**: Inventory IT systems, cloud servers, and customer data repositories.
     - **Risk Assessment**: Conduct annual risk assessments to identify threats (e.g., phishing, data breaches).
     - **Governance**: Establish cybersecurity policies aligned with business objectives.
   - **TechSecure Implementation**: Maintains an asset register and performs quarterly risk reviews.

2. **Protect**:
   - **Purpose**: Implement safeguards to ensure service delivery and data protection.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - **Access Control**: Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
     - **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data with AES-256 and use secure backups.
     - **Awareness and Training**: Conduct annual employee cybersecurity training.
   - **TechSecure Implementation**: Deploys firewalls, TLS 1.3, and mandatory training programs.

3. **Detect**:
   - **Purpose**: Identify cybersecurity events in a timely manner.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - **Continuous Monitoring**: Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for real-time alerts.
     - **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.
     - **Security Testing**: Perform monthly vulnerability scans.
   - **TechSecure Implementation**: Integrates SIEM with IDS/IPS and conducts weekly log reviews.

4. **Respond**:
   - **Purpose**: Develop and execute responses to detected cybersecurity incidents.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - **Incident Response Planning**: Maintain an incident response plan with defined roles.
     - **Communication**: Notify stakeholders during incidents per regulatory requirements.
     - **Mitigation**: Contain and eradicate threats promptly.
   - **TechSecure Implementation**: Tests incident response plans biannually and logs all incidents.

5. **Recover**:
   - **Purpose**: Restore services and capabilities affected by cybersecurity incidents.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - **Recovery Planning**: Develop and test disaster recovery plans.
     - **Backups**: Store encrypted backups offsite, tested quarterly.
     - **Improvements**: Update processes based on incident lessons learned.
   - **TechSecure Implementation**: Maintains redundant systems and conducts annual recovery drills.

## Application to TechSecure Solutions
TechSecure Solutions applies these functions to its cloud infrastructure and customer data systems, ensuring robust cybersecurity. Future documents will detail:
- [Cybersecurity Policy](../policies/cybersecurity-policy.md) (Planned)
- [NIST CSF Implementation Plan](../implementation/nist-csf-plan.md) (Planned)
- [Security Controls](../security-measures/security-controls.md) (Planned)

## Notes
- This is a **fictional** document for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Aligns with NIST CSF Version 1.1, adaptable to future updates.
