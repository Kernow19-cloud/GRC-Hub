# NIST CSF Implementation Plan for TechSecure Solutions

## Objective
Achieve compliance with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** for **TechSecure Solutions**, a fictional U.S.-based technology firm providing cloud services, by Q4 2025. This plan outlines steps to implement the five NIST CSF core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to secure IT systems and customer data. See [NIST CSF Fundamentals](../compliance/nist-csf-fundamentals.md) for function details and [Cybersecurity Policy](../policies/cybersecurity-policy.md) for policy requirements.

## Scope
- Covers all five NIST CSF core functions and their categories/subcategories.
- Applies to TechSecureâ€™s cloud infrastructure, IT systems, and employee processes.
- Targets risk-based cybersecurity improvements and alignment with business objectives.

## Steps
The implementation is structured around the NIST CSF core functions:

1. **Identify**:
   - **Asset Inventory**: Document all IT assets (servers, databases, endpoints) in a centralized register by Q2 2025.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to identify threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware) and vulnerabilities by Q2 2025.
   - **Governance**: Establish a cybersecurity governance committee to oversee NIST CSF alignment by Q2 2025.

2. **Protect**:
   - **Access Controls**: Deploy role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all systems by Q3 2025.
   - **Data Security**: Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit by Q3 2025.
   - **Training**: Roll out mandatory cybersecurity training for all employees by Q3 2025.
   - **Network Security**: Configure firewalls to restrict traffic to TCP ports 443 and 22 and deploy IPsec VPNs with MFA by Q3 2025.

3. **Detect**:
   - **Monitoring**: Integrate a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system with Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) for real-time monitoring by Q3 2025.
   - **Vulnerability Management**: Conduct monthly vulnerability scans, remediating critical issues within 30 days, starting Q3 2025.
   - **Log Analysis**: Implement weekly log reviews to detect anomalies by Q3 2025.

4. **Respond**:
   - **Incident Response Plan**: Update and test the incident response plan through biannual tabletop exercises by Q4 2025.
   - **Communication**: Establish protocols for notifying stakeholders within 72 hours of an incident by Q4 2025.
   - **Mitigation**: Deploy tools for rapid threat containment (e.g., endpoint detection and response) by Q4 2025.

5. **Recover**:
   - **Recovery Planning**: Develop and test disaster recovery plans for critical systems by Q4 2025.
   - **Backups**: Implement encrypted offsite backups, tested quarterly, by Q4 2025.
   - **Improvements**: Document lessons learned from incidents and update processes by Q4 2025.

## Timeline
- **Q2 2025**: Complete Identify phase (asset inventory, risk assessment, governance).
- **Q3 2025**: Implement Protect and Detect measures (access controls, encryption, SIEM, scans).
- **Q4 2025**: Finalize Respond and Recover phases (incident response, recovery plans, backups) and validate compliance.

## Responsible Parties
- **Cybersecurity Officer**: Oversees the implementation plan, coordinates assessments, and reports progress.
- **IT Security Team**: Configures technical controls (e.g., SIEM, firewalls, encryption) and conducts scans.
- **Training Coordinator**: Manages employee cybersecurity training programs.
- **Management**: Approves resources and ensures alignment with business goals.
- **Employees**: Participate in training and adhere to policies.

## Notes
- This is a **fictional** plan for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Aligns with NIST CSF Version 1.1, adaptable to future updates.
