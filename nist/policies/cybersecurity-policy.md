# Cybersecurity Policy for TechSecure Solutions (NIST CSF)

## Overview
This policy defines the cybersecurity requirements for **TechSecure Solutions**, a fictional U.S.-based technology firm providing cloud services, to ensure compliance with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. It addresses the five core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to safeguard customer data and IT systems. See [NIST CSF Fundamentals](../compliance/nist-csf-fundamentals.md) for function details and the [NIST CSF Project README](../readme.md) for project overview.

## Cybersecurity Policies
The following policies align with NIST CSF core functions and are mandatory for all TechSecure Solutions employees and systems:

1. **Identify**:
   - **Asset Management**: All IT assets (servers, databases, endpoints) must be inventoried in a centralized register, updated quarterly.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Annual risk assessments must identify threats and vulnerabilities, with findings reported to the Cybersecurity Officer.
   - **Governance**: All cybersecurity activities must align with TechSecureâ€™s business objectives and regulatory requirements.

2. **Protect**:
   - **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are required for all systems handling sensitive data.
   - **Data Security**: Customer data must be encrypted using AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit. Secure backups must be maintained offsite.
   - **Training**: All employees must complete annual cybersecurity training covering phishing, password management, and incident reporting.
   - **Network Security**: Firewalls must restrict traffic to authorized ports (e.g., TCP 443, 22), and VPNs with MFA are required for remote access.

3. **Detect**:
   - **Monitoring**: A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system must monitor all network traffic and log access to sensitive systems.
   - **Vulnerability Management**: Monthly vulnerability scans must be conducted, with critical findings remediated within 30 days.
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) must be configured to alert on suspicious activity.

4. **Respond**:
   - **Incident Response**: An incident response plan must be maintained, with defined roles and tested biannually through tabletop exercises.
   - **Communication**: Incidents must be reported to stakeholders within 72 hours, per regulatory requirements.
   - **Mitigation**: Detected threats must be contained and eradicated promptly, with root cause analysis documented.

5. **Recover**:
   - **Recovery Planning**: Disaster recovery plans must be documented and tested annually to ensure service restoration.
   - **Backups**: Encrypted backups must be stored offsite and tested quarterly for integrity and recoverability.
   - **Improvements**: Lessons learned from incidents must be incorporated into updated policies and plans.

## Responsibilities
- **Cybersecurity Officer**: Oversees policy implementation, risk assessments, and compliance audits.
- **IT Security Team**: Configures and maintains technical controls (e.g., SIEM, firewalls, encryption).
- **Employees**: Adhere to policies, complete training, and report incidents promptly.
- **Management**: Approves resources and ensures alignment with business goals.

## Enforcement
- Violations, such as unauthorized access or failure to follow procedures, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
- Quarterly audits will verify compliance with this policy.

## Notes
- This is a **fictional** policy for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Aligns with NIST CSF Version 1.1, adaptable to future updates.
