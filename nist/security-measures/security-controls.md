# Security Controls for TechSecure Solutions (NIST CSF)

## Overview
This document details the technical and procedural security controls implemented by **TechSecure Solutions**, a fictional U.S.-based technology firm providing cloud services, to achieve compliance with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. These controls address the five core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to secure IT systems and customer data. See [NIST CSF Fundamentals](../compliance/nist-csf-fundamentals.md) for function details, [Cybersecurity Policy](../policies/cybersecurity-policy.md) for requirements, and [NIST CSF Implementation Plan](../implementation/nist-csf-plan.md) for execution steps.

## Security Controls
The following controls are implemented to align with NIST CSF core functions:

1. **Identify**:
   - **Asset Management Database**: A centralized database tracks all IT assets (servers, databases, endpoints), updated quarterly to ensure accuracy.
   - **Risk Assessment Tool**: Automated tools perform annual risk assessments, identifying threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware) and vulnerabilities, with results reviewed by the Cybersecurity Officer.
   - **Governance Framework**: A cybersecurity governance committee meets monthly to align controls with business objectives and regulatory requirements.

2. **Protect**:
   - **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are enforced on all systems, with access reviews conducted quarterly.
   - **Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption is applied to data at rest, and TLS 1.3 secures data in transit across all cloud services.
   - **Network Security**: Firewalls restrict traffic to TCP ports 443 (HTTPS) and 22 (SSH), and IPsec VPNs with MFA secure remote access.
   - **Employee Training**: Annual cybersecurity training modules cover phishing, password management, and incident reporting, with completion tracked.

3. **Detect**:
   - **SIEM Integration**: A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, integrated with Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), monitors network traffic and generates real-time alerts.
   - **Vulnerability Scanning**: Monthly scans using automated tools identify vulnerabilities, with critical issues remediated within 30 days.
   - **Log Analysis**: Weekly log reviews detect anomalies, with findings escalated to the IT Security Team.

4. **Respond**:
   - **Incident Response Tools**: Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools enable rapid threat containment, with all incidents logged in a centralized system.
   - **Response Plan**: An incident response plan, tested biannually via tabletop exercises, defines roles and procedures for containment and eradication.
   - **Communication Protocols**: Automated workflows ensure stakeholder notification within 72 hours of an incident, per regulatory requirements.

5. **Recover**:
   - **Disaster Recovery Systems**: Redundant cloud systems and disaster recovery plans ensure service restoration, tested annually.
   - **Backup Solution**: Encrypted offsite backups, using AES-256, are tested quarterly for integrity and recoverability.
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Post-incident reviews document lessons learned, updating controls and plans as needed.

## Monitoring
- **SIEM Reviews**: Weekly reviews of SIEM alerts and logs to ensure control effectiveness.
- **Access Monitoring**: Daily audits of access logs to detect unauthorized attempts.
- **Compliance Audits**: Quarterly audits verify adherence to NIST CSF controls and policies.

## Testing
- **Vulnerability Scans**: Monthly scans to identify and remediate weaknesses.
- **Tabletop Exercises**: Biannual exercises to test incident response plans.
- **Backup Tests**: Quarterly tests to validate backup integrity and recovery processes.
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party penetration tests to assess control resilience.

## Notes
- This is a **fictional** document for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Aligns with NIST CSF Version 1.1, adaptable to future updates.
