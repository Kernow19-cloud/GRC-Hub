# PaySafe Retail – PCI-DSS Compliance Project

## Overview
This project simulates a PCI-DSS compliance program for **PaySafe Retail**, a fictional mid-sized retail company that operates both online and through physical stores. The company processes credit card payments and must comply with the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** to ensure the security of cardholder data.

The project is designed to demonstrate a practical, hands-on approach to compliance, including documentation, assessments, and implementation planning — making it suitable for learning, portfolios, and showcasing GRC capabilities.

## Objectives
- Identify gaps between current security controls and PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements.
- Assess risks related to cardholder data handling.
- Develop policies, controls, and procedures to meet compliance.
- Create a realistic implementation roadmap.
- Prepare for audit readiness and validation.
