# PaySafeRetail PCI DSS Compliance Project Overview

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the PCI DSS compliance project for PaySafeRetail, a retail organization that processes credit card payments. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that sets out security requirements for organizations handling cardholder data, aimed at minimizing the risk of data breaches [Web ID: 24]. This project ensures PaySafeRetail meets PCI DSS requirements to protect customer payment data, reduce fraud risk, and maintain trust with stakeholders.

## Objectives
- Achieve and maintain PCI DSS compliance for PaySafeRetail’s payment processing operations.
- Protect cardholder data through robust security controls, as outlined in PCI DSS v4.0.1 (the latest version as of April 2025) [Web ID: 0].
- Build customer trust by demonstrating a commitment to data security.
- Avoid financial penalties and reputational damage from non-compliance, which can include fines up to $100,000 per month for violations [Web ID: 9].

## Scope
- **Organization**: PaySafeRetail, including all systems, processes, and personnel involved in processing, storing, or transmitting cardholder data.
- **Merchant Level**: PaySafeRetail processes between 1 and 6 million transactions annually, classifying it as a Level 2 merchant under PCI DSS [Web ID: 13].
- **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)**: Includes payment terminals, e-commerce platforms, and backend systems handling cardholder data.
- **Compliance Type**: As a Level 2 merchant, PaySafeRetail will complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) annually, with the potential for an on-site assessment by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) if required by the acquiring bank [Web ID: 13].

## PCI DSS Requirements Overview
PCI DSS v4.0.1 outlines 12 requirements to secure cardholder data, which PaySafeRetail will address [Web ID: 13]:
1. Install and maintain network security controls.
2. Apply secure configurations to all system components.
3. Protect stored account data.
4. Protect cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission.
5. Protect systems from malicious software.
6. Develop and maintain secure systems and software.
7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know.
8. Identify users and authenticate access to system components.
9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
10. Log and monitor access to system components and cardholder data.
11. Test security systems and processes regularly.
12. Maintain an information security policy for all personnel.

## Project Components
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify gaps in current security practices against PCI DSS requirements.
- **Remediation Plan**: Address identified gaps with specific security controls.
- **Documentation**: Maintain policies, procedures, and evidence of compliance.
- **Training**: Educate employees on PCI DSS requirements and security best practices.
- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Conduct regular assessments and report compliance status to the acquiring bank.

## Planned Resources
The following resources will be developed in the `PaySafeRetail-PCI-DSS/` folder to support the compliance project:
- [**Gap Analysis Report**](./Gap_Analysis_Report.md): Documents gaps between current practices and PCI DSS requirements.
- [**Security Policies**](./Security_Policies.md): Defines PaySafeRetail’s information security policies (PCI DSS Requirement 12).
- [**Access Control Measures**](./Access_Control_Measures.md): Outlines measures to restrict access to cardholder data (Requirement 7).
- [**Incident Response Plan**](./Incident_Response_Plan.md): Details procedures for handling security incidents (Requirement 12.10).
- [**SAQ Completion Guide**](./SAQ_Completion_Guide.md): Guides PaySafeRetail through completing the appropriate Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ).
- [**Training Materials**](./Training_Materials.md): Provides training resources for employees on PCI DSS compliance.

## Timeline
- **Month 1-2**: Conduct gap analysis and draft security policies.
- **Month 3-4**: Implement remediation measures and document processes.
- **Month 5**: Complete employee training and finalize SAQ.
- **Month 6**: Submit SAQ to the acquiring bank and prepare for potential QSA review.
- **Ongoing**: Monitor compliance through quarterly vulnerability scans and annual assessments [Web ID: 21].

## Responsible Teams
- **Compliance Team**: Oversees the PCI DSS project and ensures documentation meets requirements.
- **IT Team**: Implements technical controls (e.g., encryption, access controls).
- **Security Team**: Manages incident response and vulnerability assessments.
- **HR Team**: Coordinates employee training on PCI DSS policies.

## Risks and Challenges
- **Complexity**: PCI DSS includes over 300 controls, which can be resource-intensive to implement [Web ID: 21].
- **Evolving Threats**: New vulnerabilities may require ongoing updates to security measures.
- **Third-Party Risks**: Non-compliance by third-party processors can impact PaySafeRetail’s compliance status, requiring careful vendor management.

## Next Steps
- Begin the gap analysis to identify compliance gaps.
- Draft initial security policies and procedures.
- Schedule employee training sessions to ensure awareness of PCI DSS requirements.
