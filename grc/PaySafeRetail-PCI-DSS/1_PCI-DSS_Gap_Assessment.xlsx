# PCI-DSS v4.0 Gap Assessment for PaySafe Retail

This directory contains the documentation, resources, and deliverables for the **Gap Assessment** phase of the PaySafe Retail PCI-DSS v4.0 Compliance Project. The gap assessment is the first step in the Implementation Plan, conducted in Q2 2025, to identify discrepancies between PaySafe Retail's current security controls and the requirements of PCI-DSS v4.0.

## Objective
Assess PaySafe Retailâ€™s current systems, processes, and controls to identify gaps against PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements, providing a foundation for the compliance roadmap.

## Scope

- **Data**: Cardholder data (CHD) and sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored, processed, or transmitted.
- **Locations**: Retail stores, online platforms, and data centers.

## Tasks
- Identify all in-scope systems and processes that interact with the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).
- Review existing security controls against PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements (e.g., network security, encryption, access controls).
- Document gaps in compliance, such as missing encryption methods or inadequate monitoring.
- Assess third-party dependencies (e.g., GitHub, Paysafe APIs) for compliance.
- Prioritize gaps based on risk and impact to compliance timeline.

## Timeline
- **Start**: April 2025
- **End**: June 2025
