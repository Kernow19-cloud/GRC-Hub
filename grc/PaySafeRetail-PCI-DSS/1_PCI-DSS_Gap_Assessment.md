# PCI-DSS Gap Assessment

## Purpose
To evaluate current security controls and identify gaps in relation to PCI-DSS requirements.

## Summary
This assessment outlines the difference between existing practices and the PCI-DSS required controls. Each control is marked as:
- **Compliant**
- **Partially Compliant**
- **Non-Compliant**

## Example Table
