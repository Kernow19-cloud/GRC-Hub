# PaySafe Retail PCI-DSS Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for PaySafe Retail to achieve and maintain PCI-DSS v4.0.1 compliance, ensuring the security of payment processing for our e-commerce platform.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third parties involved in payment processing.
- Systems and networks interacting with PaySafe’s Hosted Payments API.
- Documentation and tools in this repository.

## Security Policies
1. **Access Control (Requirement 7)**:
   - Implement role-based access control as defined in `configs/access_control.yaml`.
   - Restrict access to cardholder data environments to authorized personnel only.
   - Review access logs monthly using `src/log_monitor.py`.

2. **Data Protection (Requirement 4)**:
   - Encrypt all cardholder data in transit using TLS 1.3 (see `configs/encryption.conf`).
   - Ensure no cardholder data is stored locally, as processing is outsourced to PaySafe’s API.

3. **Vulnerability Management (Requirement 11)**:
   - Conduct monthly network vulnerability scans using `src/vulnerability_scan.py`.
   - Remediate identified vulnerabilities within 30 days.

4. **Monitoring and Logging (Requirement 10)**:
   - Monitor access logs in real-time using `src/log_monitor.py`.
   - Retain logs for at least one year, with three months immediately accessible.

5. **Network Security (Requirement 1)**:
   - Configure firewalls to restrict traffic (see `src/firewall_config.sh`).
   - Allow only necessary ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS).

6. **Security Awareness (Requirement 12.6)**:
   - Conduct annual PCI-DSS training for all employees.
   - Document training completion and store records securely.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Team**: Oversees policy implementation and annual SAQ A completion.
- **IT Team**: Maintains tools and configurations in this repository.
- **Employees**: Adhere to security policies and report incidents to compliance@paysafe-retail.com.

## Policy Review
- This policy is reviewed annually or upon significant changes to payment processing.
- Updates are documented and communicated to all relevant parties.
