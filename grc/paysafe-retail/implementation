# PaySafe Retail PCI-DSS v4.0.0 Implementation Plan

## Objective
Achieve **PCI-DSS v4.0.0** compliance for **PaySafe Retail**, a fictional mid-sized e-commerce retailer processing 3 million card transactions annually, by Q4 2025. This plan outlines the steps to secure the cardholder data environment (CDE) and validate compliance as a Level 2 merchant. See [Payment Security Policy](../policies/payment-security-policy.md) for policy details and [PCI-DSS Fundamentals](../compliance/pci-dss-fundamentals.md) for requirement overview.

## Scope
- Covers all 12 PCI-DSS v4.0.0 requirements.
- Applies to systems, processes, and personnel handling cardholder data.
- Targets validation via Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and Report on Compliance (RoC).

## Steps
1. **Scope Definition**:
   - Identify CDE components (e.g., payment servers, databases, POS terminals).
   - Document all systems and networks interacting with cardholder data.
2. **Gap Assessment**:
   - Evaluate current practices against PCI-DSS v4.0.0 requirements.
   - Identify deficiencies (e.g., missing encryption, inadequate access controls).
3. **Remediation**:
   - Deploy firewalls and network segmentation (VLANs) per Requirement 1.
   - Implement AES-256 encryption and tokenization for stored data (Requirement 3).
   - Secure transmissions with TLS 1.3 (Requirement 4).
   - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC) (Requirements 7, 8).
   - Set up SIEM for log monitoring (Requirement 10).
4. **Testing**:
   - Conduct quarterly vulnerability scans.
   - Perform annual penetration tests by a qualified third party (Requirement 11).
5. **Validation**:
   - Complete SAQ for Level 2 merchants.
   - Submit RoC to acquiring bank by Q4 2025.
6. **Ongoing Compliance**:
   - Conduct annual PCI-DSS training for employees.
   - Perform quarterly scans and regular audits.

## Timeline
- **Q2 2025**: Complete scope definition and gap assessment.
- **Q3 2025**: Remediate identified gaps (e.g., deploy controls, update configurations).
- **Q4 2025**: Validate compliance through SAQ and submit RoC.

## Responsible Parties
- **IT Security Team**: Implements technical controls (e.g., firewalls, encryption, SIEM).
- **Compliance Officer**: Manages assessments, documentation, and SAQ completion.
- **Management**: Approves resources and oversees compliance strategy.
- **Employees**: Participate in training and follow security policies.

## Notes
- This is a **fictional** plan for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Compliance activities align with PCI-DSS v4.0.0 guidelines for Level 2 merchants.
