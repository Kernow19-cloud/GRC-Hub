# PaySafe Retail Network Security Measures (PCI-DSS v4.0.0)

## Overview
This document details the network security controls implemented by **PaySafe Retail**, a fictional mid-sized e-commerce retailer processing 3 million card transactions annually, to secure the cardholder data environment (CDE) per **PCI-DSS v4.0.0** Requirement 1. These measures ensure compliance with network security requirements. See [PCI-DSS Implementation Plan](../implementation/pci-dss-plan.md) for execution steps and [Payment Security Policy](../policies/payment-security-policy.md) for policy details.

## Controls
The following controls are implemented to protect the CDE:

1. **Firewalls**:
   - Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to TCP ports 443 (HTTPS) and 22 (SSH) for secure access.
   - Deny all other unnecessary traffic to/from the CDE.

2. **Network Segmentation**:
   - Isolate the CDE using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs).
   - Restrict communication between CDE and non-CDE systems to authorized services only.

3. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**:
   - Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic and alert on suspicious activity.
   - Configure real-time responses to block potential threats.

4. **Secure Configurations**:
   - Harden all CDE servers using Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks.
   - Disable unnecessary services and remove default accounts/passwords.

5. **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**:
   - Implement IPsec VPN with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access to the CDE.
   - Ensure all remote connections are encrypted and logged.

## Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration**: Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time log analysis and alerting.
- **Configuration Reviews**: Conduct weekly reviews of firewall rules, VLAN settings, and system configurations to ensure compliance.
- **Access Monitoring**: Log and review all access to CDE systems daily.

## Testing
- **Vulnerability Scans**: Perform quarterly scans using an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) per Requirement 11.
- **Penetration Tests**: Conduct annual penetration tests by a qualified third party to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
- **Internal Testing**: Run monthly internal scans to detect configuration drift.

## Notes
- This is a **fictional** document for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Compliance is validated via Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for Level 2 merchants.
