# GRC Projects

The `grc/` directory contains company-specific Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) projects tailored to meet regulatory and industry standards for secure operations. Each project focuses on implementing and maintaining compliance frameworks for specific organizations or initiatives.

## Purpose
This directory serves as a hub for managing GRC projects, providing implementation plans, tools, policies, and resources to achieve and sustain compliance with standards like PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, GDPR, and others.

## Current Projects

The project focuses on securing cardholder data across payment processing systems, e-commerce platforms, and point-of-sale (POS) environments.
