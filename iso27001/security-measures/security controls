# Security Measures

## Overview
This folder contains planned resources for implementing security controls as part of the ISO 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) project. Security controls are selected based on ISO 27001 Annex A (aligned with ISO 27002) to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.

## Planned Resources
The following resources will be developed and added to this folder to support the implementation of security controls:

- [**Risk Assessment Report**](./Risk_Assessment_Report.md): Identifies and evaluates information security risks to determine applicable controls.
- [**Statement of Applicability (SoA)**](./Statement_of_Applicability.md): Documents the selected ISO 27001 Annex A controls and their justification.
- [**Access Control Policy**](./Access_Control_Policy.md): Defines measures for managing access to systems and data (Annex A.9).
- [**Incident Response Plan**](./Incident_Response_Plan.md): Outlines procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents (Annex A.16).
- [**Asset Inventory**](./Asset_Inventory.md): Lists all information assets to ensure they are protected (Annex A.8).
- [**Security Awareness Training**](./Security_Awareness_Training.md): Materials for training employees on ISO 27001 security controls (Annex A.7).

## Next Steps
- **Timeline**: Initial resources will be drafted within the first 3 months, with full implementation of controls targeted within 12 months.
- **Responsible Teams**: Information Security team will lead the implementation, collaborating with IT for technical controls and HR for training.
- **Milestones**:
  - Risk assessment completion: Month 1.
  - Statement of Applicability: Month 2.
  - Control implementation and training: Months 3-9.
  - Internal audit and review: Months 10-12.
