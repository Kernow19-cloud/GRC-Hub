# Security Controls for SecureCorp (ISO27001)

## Overview
This document details the **security controls** implemented by **SecureCorp**, a fictional organization, to support its **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** Information Security Management System (ISMS). These controls, derived from Annex A, ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, including customer data, intellectual property, and IT systems. The controls are selected based on the risk assessment and Statement of Applicability (SoA) outlined in the [ISO27001 Implementation Plan](../implementation/iso27001-plan.md). See also [ISO27001 Fundamentals](../compliance/iso27001-fundamentals.md), [Information Security Policy](../policies/information-security-policy.md), and [ISO27001 Project README](../readme.md) for context.

## Security Controls
