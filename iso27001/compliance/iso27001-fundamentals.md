# ISO27001 Fundamentals for SecureCorp

## Overview
This document outlines the **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** fundamentals for **SecureCorp**, a fictional organization implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) to protect assets, including customer data, intellectual property, and IT systems. ISO27001 is the international standard for information security, providing a framework for managing risks and ensuring compliance. This supports SecureCorp’s compliance efforts as detailed in the [ISO27001 Project README](../readme.md).

## ISO27001 Core Components
ISO27001:2022 consists of Clauses 4-10 (main requirements) and Annex A (controls). Below are the key components and SecureCorp’s approach:

### Clauses 4-10: ISMS Requirements
1. **Clause 4: Context of the Organization**:
   - **Requirement**: Understand internal/external issues, stakeholders, and ISMS scope.
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Define ISMS scope covering IT systems, cloud services, and facilities. Conduct stakeholder analysis to identify compliance needs.

2. **Clause 5: Leadership**:
   - **Requirement**: Leadership commitment, policy establishment, and role assignments.
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Appoint an Information Security Manager and establish an ISMS policy approved by management.

3. **Clause 6: Planning**:
   - **Requirement**: Address risks, set objectives, and plan ISMS implementation.
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Perform risk assessments using ISO31000, set security objectives (e.g., 99.9% uptime), and document risk treatment plans.

4. **Clause 7: Support**:
   - **Requirement**: Ensure resources, competence, awareness, communication, and documentation.
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Provide annual ISO27001 training, allocate budget for security tools, and maintain documented procedures.

5. **Clause 8: Operation**:
   - **Requirement**: Implement risk treatment plans and operational controls.
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Deploy Annex A controls (e.g., encryption, access controls) and conduct quarterly risk reviews.

6. **Clause 9: Performance Evaluation**:
   - **Requirement**: Monitor, measure, analyze, and audit ISMS performance.
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Conduct internal audits annually and management reviews biannually to evaluate ISMS effectiveness.

7. **Clause 10: Improvement**:
   - **Requirement**: Address nonconformities and improve ISMS.
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Implement corrective actions for audit findings and update ISMS based on new threats.

### Annex A: Controls
Annex A provides 93 controls across four domains, tailored to SecureCorp’s needs:
1. **Organizational Controls (37 controls)**:
   - **Examples**: A.5.1.1 (Policies for Information Security), A.5.1.2 (Review of Policies).
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Develop an Information Security Policy and review it annually.

2. **People Controls (8 controls)**:
   - **Examples**: A.6.1.2 (Screening), A.6.2.2 (Teleworking).
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Conduct background checks for employees and enforce secure remote work policies.

3. **Physical Controls (14 controls)**:
   - **Examples**: A.7.2.1 (Equipment Protection), A.7.2.2 (Secure Areas).
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Install biometric access controls and secure server rooms.

4. **Technological Controls (34 controls)**:
   - **Examples**: A.8.1.1 (Access Control Policy), A.8.2.3 (Cryptographic Controls).
   - **SecureCorp Approach**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and AES-256 encryption.

## SecureCorp’s Compliance Strategy
- **Risk-Based Approach**: Use ISO31000 to identify and prioritize risks, applying Annex A controls as needed.
- **Documentation**: Maintain a Statement of Applicability (SoA) listing applicable controls and justifications.
- **Training**: Annual employee training on ISO27001 and security best practices.
- **Audits**: Annual internal audits and third-party certification audits to validate compliance.
- **Tools**: Deploy tools like firewalls, SIEM systems, and vulnerability scanners to support controls.

## Notes
- This is a **fictional** document for educational and portfolio purposes.
