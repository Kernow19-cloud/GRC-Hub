# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Template

## Overview
This template provides a structured approach to conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), as required by Article 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A DPIA is mandatory when processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, such as large-scale processing of sensitive data, systematic monitoring, or use of new technologies.

## When to Use This Template
- **High-Risk Processing**: Use this DPIA for activities identified as high-risk in the [GDPR Gap Analysis](./GDPR_Gap_Analysis.md), such as processing sensitive personal data (e.g., health data) or profiling customers.
- **New Projects**: Apply this template to new systems, processes, or technologies involving personal data.
- **Regulatory Requirement**: Conduct a DPIA if instructed by a supervisory authority or if the processing meets criteria outlined in GDPR Article 35.

## DPIA Steps

### 1. Project Description
- **Project Name**: [Insert project name, e.g., "Customer Profiling for Marketing"]
- **Purpose**: [Describe the purpose of the processing, e.g., "To analyze customer behavior for targeted marketing campaigns."]
- **Scope**:
  - Data Types: [e.g., Names, email addresses, purchase history, browsing behavior]
  - Data Subjects: [e.g., EU customers]
  - Systems Involved: [e.g., CRM system, marketing analytics platform]
- **Legal Basis**: [Reference the lawful basis from [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md), e.g., "Consent under GDPR Article 6(1)(a)"]
- **Third Parties**: [List third-party processors involved, if any, and confirm [Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)](./Data_Processing_Agreements.md) are in place.]

### 2. Necessity and Proportionality Assessment
- **Necessity**: [Explain why the processing is necessary to achieve the purpose, e.g., "Profiling is necessary to deliver personalized marketing, which increases customer engagement."]
- **Proportionality**: [Assess if the processing is proportionate to the purpose, e.g., "Only minimal data (e.g., purchase history) is collected; sensitive data is excluded."]
- **Alternatives**: [Consider less intrusive alternatives, e.g., "Opt-in surveys were considered but deemed less effective for large-scale analysis."]

### 3. Risk Identification
Identify risks to individualsâ€™ rights and freedoms:
- **Risk 1**: Unauthorized access to personal data.
  - Likelihood: [e.g., Medium]
  - Impact: [e.g., High (potential identity theft)]
- **Risk 2**: Lack of transparency in profiling.
  - Likelihood: [e.g., High]
  - Impact: [e.g., Medium (loss of trust)]
- **Risk 3**: Data breach leading to exposure of sensitive data.
  - Likelihood: [e.g., Low]
  - Impact: [e.g., High (reputational damage)]

### 4. Risk Mitigation Measures
Propose measures to mitigate identified risks:
- **Risk 1 Mitigation**: Implement encryption and access controls; train staff using [Training Materials](./Training_Materials.md).
- **Risk 2 Mitigation**: Update [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md) to clearly explain profiling practices; ensure opt-in consent.
- **Risk 3 Mitigation**: Establish a breach notification process as outlined in [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md); conduct regular security audits.

### 5. Consultation
- **Internal Stakeholders**: [e.g., Consulted IT, legal, and marketing teams to assess risks and mitigation measures.]
- **Data Subjects**: [e.g., Sought feedback from a sample of customers via surveys to understand their concerns about profiling.]
- **External Experts**: [e.g., Engaged a GDPR consultant to review the DPIA.]

### 6. Residual Risks
- **Remaining Risks**: [e.g., "After mitigation, the risk of unauthorized access is reduced to Low, but some risk remains due to third-party vendor dependencies."]
- **Acceptability**: [e.g., "Residual risks are acceptable given the measures in place and the necessity of the processing."]

### 7. Outcome and Sign-Off
- **DPO Recommendation**: [e.g., "The Data Protection Officer (DPO) approves the processing, provided all mitigation measures are implemented."]
- **Approval**: [e.g., "Approved by: [Name], DPO, [Date]"]
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement mitigation measures by [deadline].
  - Monitor risks and update the DPIA as needed.
  - Document any data subject requests related to this processing in the [Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) Process](./DSAR_Process.md).

## Additional Notes
- **Training**: Ensure all staff involved in the project are trained on GDPR requirements using [Training Materials](./Training_Materials.md).
- **Monitoring**: Refer to the [gdpr/README.md](../gdpr/README.md) for timelines on ongoing monitoring and audit preparation.
- **Documentation**: Retain this DPIA as evidence of compliance for supervisory authority reviews.

## Responsible Teams
- **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Oversees the DPIA process and provides approval.
- **IT Team**: Implements technical mitigation measures (e.g., encryption, access controls).
- **Legal Team**: Ensures lawful basis and third-party compliance.
