# GDPR Gap Analysis

## Overview
This document provides a gap analysis to identify discrepancies between current organizational practices and the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The goal is to assess compliance with EU data protection laws, highlight areas of non-compliance, and propose actionable steps to address gaps.

## Scope
- **Organization**: All departments handling personal data of EU residents.
- **Processes**: Data collection, storage, processing, and sharing.
- **Systems**: Customer databases, CRM systems, marketing tools, and third-party integrations.
- **GDPR Articles Covered**: Key articles including data subject rights (Articles 15-22), lawful basis for processing (Article 6), data protection by design (Article 25), and breach notification (Articles 33-34).

## Gap Analysis

### 1. Lawful Basis for Processing (Article 6)
- **Requirement**: All personal data processing must have a lawful basis (e.g., consent, legitimate interest).
- **Current State**: Consent is collected for marketing emails, but other processes (e.g., CRM data retention) rely on unclear justifications.
- **Gap**: Lack of documented lawful basis for all processing activities; consent forms may not meet GDPR standards (e.g., not granular or easily withdrawable).
- **Action Item**: Document lawful basis for all processes; update consent mechanisms to be specific, informed, and revocable. Refer to [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md) for updates.

### 2. Data Subject Rights (Articles 15-22)
- **Requirement**: Individuals have rights to access, rectify, erase, and restrict processing of their personal data.
- **Current State**: No formal process exists for handling Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs); requests are handled ad hoc.
- **Gap**: Absence of a standardized DSAR process; staff are not trained to handle requests within the 30-day GDPR timeline.
- **Action Item**: Develop a DSAR process and train staff. See [Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) Process](./DSAR_Process.md) for planned guidelines.

### 3. Data Protection by Design and Default (Article 25)
- **Requirement**: Implement technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection (e.g., pseudonymization, minimal data collection).
- **Current State**: Customer data is collected without clear minimization; no pseudonymization in use.
- **Gap**: Data minimization principles not applied; lack of technical measures like pseudonymization or encryption for sensitive data.
- **Action Item**: Conduct a [Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)](./DPIA_Template.md) for high-risk processes; implement data minimization and encryption.

### 4. Data Breach Notification (Articles 33-34)
- **Requirement**: Notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours of a data breach; inform affected individuals if high risk.
- **Current State**: No formal breach notification process; incident response is reactive.
- **Gap**: Lack of a documented breach response plan; staff unaware of notification timelines.
- **Action Item**: Include breach notification procedures in [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md); train staff using [Training Materials](./Training_Materials.md).

### 5. Third-Party Data Processing (Article 28)
- **Requirement**: Ensure third-party processors comply with GDPR via Data Processing Agreements (DPAs).
- **Current State**: Some vendors lack DPAs; compliance status of third parties is unknown.
- **Gap**: Missing or incomplete DPAs; no vendor audit process.
- **Action Item**: Draft and sign DPAs with all vendors. See [Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)](./Data_Processing_Agreements.md) for templates.

## Summary of Gaps and Priorities
| **GDPR Requirement**           | **Gap Identified**                          | **Priority** | **Action Owner**   |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Lawful Basis (Article 6)      | Undocumented basis; inadequate consent      | High         | Compliance Team    |
| Data Subject Rights           | No DSAR process; untrained staff            | High         | Legal Team         |
| Data Protection by Design     | No minimization or pseudonymization         | Medium       | IT Team            |
| Breach Notification           | No formal process or training               | High         | Security Team      |
| Third-Party Processing        | Missing DPAs; no vendor audits              | Medium       | Procurement Team   |

## Next Steps
- **Timeline**: Address high-priority gaps within Month 1; medium-priority gaps by Month 2 (as per [gdpr/README.md](../gdpr/README.md)).
- **Training**: Use [Training Materials](./Training_Materials.md) to educate staff on GDPR requirements and gap remediation.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly review progress on action items and update this gap analysis as needed.

## Responsible Teams
- **Compliance Team**: Oversee gap closure and policy updates.
- **Legal Team**: Develop DSAR processes and DPAs.
- **IT Team**: Implement technical measures (e.g., encryption, pseudonymization).
- **Security Team**: Establish breach notification procedures.
