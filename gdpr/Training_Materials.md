# Training Materials

## Overview
This document provides training materials for employees to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Training is essential for handling personal data responsibly, responding to data breaches, and fulfilling data subject rights, addressing gaps identified in the [GDPR Gap Analysis](./GDPR_Gap_Analysis.md) regarding staff awareness and training.

## Training Objectives
- Understand GDPR principles and requirements.
- Learn how to handle personal data in compliance with the [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md).
- Follow procedures for [Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs)](./DSAR_Process.md) and data breach notifications.
- Ensure third-party compliance through [Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)](./Data_Processing_Agreements.md).
- Identify when a [Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)](./DPIA_Template.md) is required.

## Training Content

### 1. GDPR Basics
- **What is GDPR?**: A regulation to protect EU residents' personal data, effective since May 25, 2018.
- **Key Principles** (GDPR Article 5):
  - Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.
  - Purpose limitation and data minimization.
  - Accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality.
  - Accountability.
- **Rights of Data Subjects** (Articles 15-22): Access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection.
- **Penalties**: Fines up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of annual global turnover for non-compliance.

### 2. Handling Personal Data
- **Collection**: Only collect data necessary for the purpose, as outlined in the [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md).
- **Consent**: Obtain explicit, granular consent for non-essential processing (e.g., marketing); allow easy withdrawal.
- **Storage**: Encrypt and secure personal data; limit access to authorized personnel only.
- **Retention**: Delete data when no longer needed, per retention policies in the [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md).

### 3. Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs)
- **Process**: Follow the [Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) Process](./DSAR_Process.md) to handle requests within one month.
- **Examples**:
  - Access: Provide a copy of the data subject's personal data.
  - Erasure: Delete data upon request, unless legally required to retain it.
- **Action**: Report DSARs to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) immediately for logging and response.

### 4. Data Breach Response
- **Identification**: Recognize signs of a breach (e.g., unauthorized access, data loss).
- **Reporting**: Notify the DPO within 24 hours; the DPO will assess and notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours if required, per the [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md).
- **Mitigation**: Take immediate steps (e.g., suspend accounts, patch vulnerabilities) and document the incident.

### 5. Third-Party Compliance
- **Vendor Management**: Ensure all third-party processors have signed [Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)](./Data_Processing_Agreements.md).
- **Risk Assessment**: Conduct a [Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)](./DPIA_Template.md) for high-risk processing involving third parties.
- **Action**: Report any third-party breaches to the DPO for coordinated response.

## Sample Training Agenda
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Format**: In-person or virtual session
- **Agenda**:
  1. Introduction to GDPR (15 minutes)
     - Overview, principles, and penalties.
  2. Handling Personal Data (30 minutes)
     - Collection, consent, storage, and retention.
  3. DSAR Process (30 minutes)
     - Step-by-step guide with examples.
  4. Data Breach Response (30 minutes)
     - Identification, reporting, and mitigation.
  5. Third-Party Compliance (15 minutes)
     - DPAs and risk assessments.

## Training Delivery
- **Frequency**: Annual training for all employees; additional sessions for new hires during onboarding.
- **Methods**:
  - Interactive workshops with case studies (e.g., mock DSAR handling).
  - E-learning modules with quizzes to test understanding.
- **Resources**:
  - Slides or videos summarizing GDPR principles.
  - Handouts of the [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md) and [DSAR Process](./DSAR_Process.md).

## Assessment and Follow-Up
- **Quiz**: Conduct a post-training quiz to assess understanding (e.g., "What is the timeline for responding to a DSAR?").
- **Feedback**: Collect feedback to improve future sessions.
- **Monitoring**: Track attendance and quiz scores; require retraining for employees who fail to meet standards.
- **Updates**: Revise training materials based on changes to GDPR requirements or organizational processes, as noted in the [gdpr/README.md](../gdpr/README.md).

## Responsible Teams
- **Compliance Team**: Develops and updates training materials.
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Coordinates training sessions and tracks attendance.
- **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Reviews training content for accuracy and compliance.
- **IT/Security Team**: Provides input on technical aspects (e.g., breach response, encryption).

## Next Steps
- **Timeline**: Roll out initial training by Month 3, as outlined in the [gdpr/README.md](../gdpr/README.md).
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of training attendance and quiz results for compliance audits.
- **Integration**: Ensure training aligns with procedures in the [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md) and [Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)](./Data_Processing_Agreements.md).
