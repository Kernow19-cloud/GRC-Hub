# Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) Process

## Overview
This document outlines the process for handling Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A DSAR allows individuals to exercise their rights over their personal data, including the right to access (Article 15), rectification (Article 16), erasure (Article 17), and restriction of processing (Article 18). This process addresses gaps identified in the [GDPR Gap Analysis](./GDPR_Gap_Analysis.md) regarding the lack of a standardized DSAR procedure.

## Scope
- **Applicability**: Applies to all personal data processed by the organization, including customer, employee, and third-party data.
- **Rights Covered**: Access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection to processing.
- **Timeline**: GDPR requires DSARs to be fulfilled within one month of receipt, with a possible extension of two additional months for complex requests.

## DSAR Process

### 1. Receiving a DSAR
- **Channels**: DSARs can be submitted via email, a dedicated online form, or in writing to the Data Protection Officer (DPO). Contact details are provided in the [Privacy Policies](./Privacy_Policies.md).
- **Identification**: Verify the identity of the requester to prevent unauthorized access to personal data (e.g., request a copy of a government-issued ID).
- **Logging**: Record the DSAR in a tracking system, noting the date of receipt, type of request, and requester’s details.

### 2. Assessing the Request
- **Validity**: Confirm the request falls under GDPR rights (e.g., requesting access to personal data, not general inquiries).
- **Complexity**: Determine if the request is complex (e.g., involves large volumes of data or third-party data), which may justify an extension.
- **Fees**: DSARs are generally free, but a reasonable fee may be charged for excessive or unfounded requests (GDPR Article 12(5)).

### 3. Gathering Data
- **Search**: Identify all systems and processes where the requester’s data may reside (e.g., CRM, email archives, HR systems).
- **Third Parties**: If data is held by third-party processors, coordinate with them as per the [Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)](./Data_Processing_Agreements.md).
- **Redaction**: Redact any third-party personal data or confidential information that should not be disclosed.

### 4. Responding to the Request
- **Format**: Provide the response in a commonly used electronic format (e.g., PDF) unless otherwise requested.
- **Content**:
  - For **Access Requests**: Provide a copy of the personal data, along with details on the purpose of processing, categories of data, recipients, and retention period.
  - For **Rectification/Erasure**: Confirm the action taken (e.g., “Data corrected as requested” or “Data deleted”).
  - For **Objection/Restriction**: Explain the outcome (e.g., “Processing restricted pending review”).
- **Template Response**:
