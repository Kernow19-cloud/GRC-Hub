# GDPR Compliance Resources

## Overview
This folder contains planned resources for GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance, focusing on EU data protection requirements. The goal is to ensure that organizational practices align with GDPR to protect personal data and meet regulatory obligations in the European Union.

## Planned Resources
The following resources will be developed and added to this folder as part of GDPR compliance efforts:

- [**GDPR Gap Analysis**](./GDPR_Gap_Analysis.md): A document or spreadsheet identifying gaps between current practices and GDPR requirements (e.g., data subject rights, consent management).
- [**Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**](./DPIA_Template.md): A template or completed assessment for processes involving personal data, as required by GDPR Article 35.
- [**Privacy Policies**](./Privacy_Policies.md): Drafted policies for data processing, user consent, and data breach notifications, aligned with GDPR principles.
- [**Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) Process**](./DSAR_Process.md): Guidelines and templates for handling requests from individuals to access, rectify, or delete their personal data.
- [**Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)**](./Data_Processing_Agreements.md): Contracts or templates for agreements with third-party vendors to ensure GDPR-compliant data processing.
- [**Training Materials**](./Training_Materials.md): Resources for employee training on GDPR requirements, such as handling personal data and responding to data breaches.

## Next Steps
- **Timeline**: Initial resources will be drafted within the first 3 months, with full compliance targeted within 12 months.
- **Responsible Teams**: Compliance and legal teams will lead GDPR efforts, collaborating with IT for technical implementations (e.g., data encryption, access controls).
- **Milestones**:
  - Gap analysis completion: Month 1.
  - Policy drafting and approval: Month 2.
  - Employee training: Month 3.
  - Ongoing monitoring and audit preparation: Months 4-12.
