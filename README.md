# GRC-Hub

Welcome to **GRC-Hub**, a collection of simulated **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** projects for educational and portfolio purposes. This repository hosts fictional company projects demonstrating compliance with industry standards, including **PCI-DSS**, **GDPR**, **NIST**, **PDPA**, and **ISO27001**.

## Purpose
GRC-Hub aims to:
- Simulate real-world compliance programs for fictional companies across multiple frameworks: **PCI-DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation), **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology frameworks, e.g., CSF, 800-53), **PDPA** (Personal Data Protection Act), and **ISO27001** (Information Security Management).
- Provide hands-on examples of GRC documentation, policies, implementation plans, and security measures.
- Serve as a portfolio to showcase expertise in cybersecurity and compliance.

## Repository Structure
- **[grc/](grc/)**: Company-specific GRC projects, such as PaySafe Retail for PCI-DSS compliance.
- **[nist/](nist/)**: Planned resources for NIST frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST 800-53).
- **[gdpr/](gdpr/)**: Planned resources for GDPR compliance (EU data protection).
- **[pdpa/](pdpa/)**: Planned resources for PDPA compliance (data protection for jurisdictions like Singapore).
- **[iso27001/](iso27001/)**: Planned resources for ISO27001 compliance (information security management).

## Projects
- **TechNova Solutions – PCI-DSS Compliance Project

A fictional e-commerce retailer’s PCI-DSS v4.0 compliance program, designed to showcase practical GRC knowledge in a real-world business context. The project includes:
	•	PCI-DSS Fundamentals
Overview of the PCI-DSS v4.0 framework, scope, and key requirements.
	•	Payment Security Policy
A tailored security policy outlining how TechNova handles, stores, and protects cardholder data (CHD).
	•	Implementation Plan
Step-by-step strategy for achieving PCI-DSS compliance, including milestones and responsible roles.
	•	Network Security Measures
Technical and procedural controls implemented to secure the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), including firewalls, segmentation, and encryption.
- **Planned Projects**:
  - **GDPR**: Compliance program for a fictional EU-based company (e.g., TechTrend Innovations).
  - **NIST**: Implementation of NIST CSF or 800-53 for a fictional U.S. organisation.
  - **PDPA**: Data protection program for a fictional company in a PDPA-regulated region (e.g., Singapore).

## Getting Started
1. Explore the **[grc/](grc/)** folder for the PaySafe Retail PCI-DSS project.
2. Review planned folders (`nist/`, `gdpr/`, `pdpa/`, `iso27001/`) for upcoming projects.
3. Check back for new compliance simulations as the repository grows.

## Notes
- All projects are **fictional** and intended for educational use only.
