# GRC-Hub

Welcome to **GRC-Hub**, a collection of simulated **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** projects for educational and portfolio purposes. This repository hosts fictional company projects demonstrating compliance with industry standards, including **PCI-DSS**, **GDPR**, **NIST**, **PDPA**, and **ISO27001**.

## Purpose
GRC-Hub aims to:
- Simulate real-world compliance programs for fictional companies across multiple frameworks: **PCI-DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation), **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology frameworks, e.g., CSF, 800-53), **PDPA** (Personal Data Protection Act), and **ISO27001** (Information Security Management).
- Provide hands-on examples of GRC documentation, policies, implementation plans, and security measures.
- Serve as a portfolio to showcase expertise in cybersecurity and compliance.

## Repository Structure
- **[grc/](grc/)**: Company-specific GRC projects, such as PaySafe Retail for PCI-DSS compliance.
- **[nist/](nist/)**: Planned resources for NIST frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST 800-53).
- **[gdpr/](gdpr/)**: Planned resources for GDPR compliance (EU data protection).
- **[pdpa/](pdpa/)**: Planned resources for PDPA compliance (data protection for jurisdictions like Singapore).
- **[iso27001/](iso27001/)**: Planned resources for ISO27001 compliance (information security

# [TechNova Solutions](pci_dss_fundamentals.md) PCI-DSS Compliance Project

This project outlines **[TechNova Solutions](pci_dss_fundamentals.md)**, a fictional e-commerce retailer's compliance program for [PCI-DSS v4.0.0](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). The program ensures secure handling of cardholder data, aligning with industry standards for payment security.

## PCI-DSS Fundamentals

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. [PCI-DSS v4.0.0](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss) introduces updated requirements to address evolving threats.

For details, see the full **[TechNova Solutions](pci_dss_fundamentals.md) PCI-DSS Fundamentals**.

### Key Requirements
PCI-DSS v4.0.0 is organized into **12 requirements** grouped under six objectives:

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems**
   - Install and maintain network security controls.
   - Apply secure configurations to systems.
2. **Protect Account Data**
   - Protect stored account data.
   - Encrypt transmission of cardholder data.
3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**
   - Protect systems from malware.
   - Develop and maintain secure systems and software.
4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**
   - Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know.
   - Identify and authenticate access to system components.
   - Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**
   - Track and monitor access to network resources and cardholder data.
   - Regularly test security systems and processes.
6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**
   - Maintain a policy that addresses information security.

For detailed requirements, refer to the [PCI-DSS v4.0.0 Documentation](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss).

## Payment Security Policy

**[TechNova Solutions](payment_security_policy.md)** has established a **Payment Security Policy** to protect cardholder data and ensure compliance with PCI-DSS v4.0.0. The policy applies to all systems, personnel, and processes within the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).

For details, see the full **[TechNova Solutions](payment_security_policy.md) Payment Security Policy**.

### Policy Components
1. **Data Retention and Disposal**
   - Cardholder data is retained only as long as necessary for business, legal, or regulatory purposes.
   - Secure data disposal methods (e.g., shredding, secure wiping) are used for physical and digital records.
2. **Data Minimization**
   - Only essential cardholder data (e.g., Primary Account Number, expiration date) is collected and stored.
   - Sensitive authentication data (e.g., CVV, PIN) is not stored post-authorization.
3. **Encryption**
   - Cardholder data is encrypted at rest using AES-256.
   - Data transmitted over public networks is encrypted using TLS 1.3.
4. **Access Control**
   - Access to cardholder data is restricted to authorized personnel with a business need.
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced for all CDE access.
5. **Incident Response**
   - A documented incident response plan addresses data breaches.
   - Regular training ensures staff readiness for security incidents.

For a template policy, see the [PCI Security Standards Council Guidance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security).

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan outlines steps to achieve and maintain PCI-DSS v4.0.0 compliance for **[TechNova Solutions](implementation_plan.md)**.

For details, see the full **[TechNova Solutions](implementation_plan.md) Implementation Plan**.

### Phase 1: Scoping and Assessment (0-3 Months)
- **Identify CDE**: Map systems, networks, and processes that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.
- **Gap Analysis**: Conduct a gap assessment against PCI-DSS v4.0.0 requirements.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and prioritize risks to cardholder data.

### Phase 2: Remediation (4-9 Months)
- **Policy Development**: Formalize the Payment Security Policy.
- **Technical Controls**: Implement encryption, MFA, and network security measures (see [Network Security Measures](#network-security-measures)).
- **Staff Training**: Conduct PCI-DSS awareness training for all employees.

### Phase 3: Validation (10-12 Months)
- **Internal Audit**: Perform an internal audit to verify compliance.
- **Engage QSA**: Work with a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) for formal validation.
- **Submit ROC/SAQ**: Complete the Report on Compliance (ROC) or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ).

### Phase 4: Ongoing Compliance
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring tools.
- **Annual Assessments**: Conduct annual PCI-DSS assessments.
- **Quarterly Scans**: Perform ASV-approved vulnerability scans ([Approved Scanning Vendors](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/approved_scanning_vendors)).

## Network Security Measures

The Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) is protected by robust network security controls to meet PCI-DSS v4.0.0 requirements.

For details, see the full **[TechNova Solutions](network_security_measures.md) Network Security Measures**.

### Key Controls
1. **Network Segmentation**
   - The CDE is isolated from other networks using firewalls.
   - VLANs and access control lists (ACLs) restrict traffic to authorized flows.
2. **Firewall and Intrusion Prevention**
   - Next-generation firewalls (NGFW) filter inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) monitor for suspicious activity.
3. **Endpoint Security**
   - Anti-malware solutions are deployed on all CDE systems.
   - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools provide real-time threat detection.
4. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Monthly vulnerability scans identify and remediate weaknesses.
   - Patch management ensures systems are updated within 30 days of patch release.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Centralized logging captures all access to CDE systems.
   - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools provide real-time alerts.
