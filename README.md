# GRC-Hub

Welcome to **GRC-Hub**, a collection of simulated **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** projects for educational and portfolio purposes. This repository hosts fictional company projects demonstrating compliance with industry standards, including **PCI-DSS**, **GDPR**, **NIST**, **PDPA**, and **ISO27001**.

## Purpose
GRC-Hub aims to:
- Simulate real-world compliance programs for fictional companies across multiple frameworks: **PCI-DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation), **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology frameworks, e.g., CSF, 800-53), **PDPA** (Personal Data Protection Act), and **ISO27001** (Information Security Management).
- Provide hands-on examples of GRC documentation, policies, implementation plans, and security measures.
- Serve as a portfolio to showcase expertise in cybersecurity and compliance.

## Repository Structure
- **[grc/](grc/)**: Company-specific GRC projects, such as PaySafe Retail for PCI-DSS compliance.
- **[nist/](nist/)**: Planned resources for NIST frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST 800-53).
- **[gdpr/](gdpr/)**: Planned resources for GDPR compliance (EU data protection).
- **[pdpa/](pdpa/)**: Planned resources for PDPA compliance (data protection for jurisdictions like Singapore).
- **[iso27001/](iso27001/)**: Planned resources for ISO27001 compliance (information security management).

## Projects
- # TechNova Solutions PCI-DSS Compliance Project

This project outlines **TechNova Solutions**, a fictional e-commerce retailer's compliance program for [PCI-DSS v4.0.0](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). The program ensures secure handling of cardholder data, aligning with industry standards for payment security.

## PCI-DSS Fundamentals

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. [PCI-DSS v4.0.0](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss) introduces updated requirements to address evolving threats.

### Key Requirements
PCI-DSS v4.0.0 is organized into **12 requirements** grouped under six objectives:

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems**
   - Install and maintain network security controls.
   - Apply secure configurations to systems.
2. **Protect Account Data**
   - Protect stored account data.
   - Encrypt transmission of cardholder data.
3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**
   - Protect systems from malware.
   - Develop and maintain secure systems and software.
4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**
   - Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know.
   - Identify and authenticate access to system components.
   - Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**
   - Track and monitor access to network resources and cardholder data.
   - Regularly test security systems and processes.
6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**
   - Maintain a policy that addresses information security.

For detailed requirements, refer to the [PCI-DSS v4.0.0 Documentation](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss).

## Payment Security Policy

TechNova Solutions has established a **Payment Security Policy** to protect cardholder data and ensure compliance with PCI-DSS v4.0.0. The policy applies to all systems, personnel, and processes within the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).

### Policy Components
1. **Data Retention and Disposal**
   - Cardholder data is retained only as long as necessary for business, legal, or regulatory purposes.
   - Secure data disposal methods (e.g., shredding, secure wiping) are used for physical and digital records.
2. **Data Minimization**
   - Only essential cardholder data (e.g., Primary Account Number, expiration date) is collected and stored.
   - Sensitive authentication data (e.g., CVV, PIN) is not stored post-authorization.
3. **Encryption**
   - Cardholder data is encrypted at rest using AES-256.

- **Planned Projects**:
  - **GDPR**: Compliance program for a fictional EU-based company (e.g., TechTrend Innovations).
  - **NIST**: Implementation of NIST CSF or 800-53 for a fictional U.S. organisation.
  - **PDPA**: Data protection program for a fictional company in a PDPA-regulated region (e.g., Singapore).

## Getting Started
1. Explore the **[grc/](grc/)** folder for the PaySafe Retail PCI-DSS project.
2. Review planned folders (`nist/`, `gdpr/`, `pdpa/`, `iso27001/`) for upcoming projects.
3. Check back for new compliance simulations as the repository grows.
