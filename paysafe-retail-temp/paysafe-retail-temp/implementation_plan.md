# PCI-DSS v4.0.0 Implementation Plan

## Objective
Achieve and maintain PCI-DSS v4.0.0 compliance for PaySafe Retail, an e-commerce retailer outsourcing payment processing to PaySafe’s Hosted Payments API (SAQ A scope).

## Steps
1. **Define Scope (Month 1)**
   - Confirm no cardholder data is stored or processed locally (Requirement 3).
   - Document outsourcing to PaySafe’s Hosted Payments API (`docs/saq_a.md`).
   - Identify systems interacting with the API (e.g., e-commerce platform).

2. **Implement Network Security (Months 1-2)**
   - Configure firewalls to restrict traffic (`src/firewall_config.sh`, Requirement 1).
   - Conduct initial vulnerability scan (`src/vulnerability_scan.py`, Requirement 11).
   - Apply secure configurations to API integration systems (Requirement 2).

3. **Secure Payment Processing (Months 2-3)**
   - Enforce TLS 1.3 for API calls (`configs/encryption.conf`, Requirement 4).
   - Deploy API integration (`examples/hosted_payment_api.py`).
   - Verify no local storage of cardholder data.

4. **Establish Access Controls (Month 3)**
   - Implement role-based access control (`configs/access_control.yaml`, Requirement 7).
   - Restrict access to payment systems to `admin` and `payment_processor` roles.
   - Train staff on access policies (Requirement 12.6).

5. **Set Up Monitoring and Logging (Month 4)**
   - Deploy log monitoring for payment API interactions (`src/log_monitor.py`, Requirement 10).
   - Configure logging for API calls (`logs/payment_api.log`).
   - Test log retention and access controls.

6. **Complete SAQ A and Validation (Month 5)**
   - Complete Self-Assessment Questionnaire A (`docs/saq_a.md`).
   - Submit Attestation of Compliance (AOC) to acquirer.
   - Document compliance evidence (e.g., scan reports, logs).

7. **Ongoing Maintenance (Month 6+)**
   - Run monthly vulnerability scans (`src/vulnerability_scan.py`).
   - Review logs weekly (`src/log_monitor.py`).
   - Update policies annually (`payment_security_policy.md`, `docs/pci_dss_policy.md`).
   - Conduct annual staff training.

## Timeline
- **Months 1-5**: Initial compliance implementation.
- **Month 6+**: Ongoing monitoring and maintenance.
